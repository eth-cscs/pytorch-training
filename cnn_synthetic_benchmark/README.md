# Benchmarking the throughput of CNNs with synthetic data

Here we provide scripts to benchmark the throughput in images/sec of CNNs with synthetic data.
We use models from [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html).

The content here is based on Horovod's example [pytorch_synthetic_benchmark.py](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/examples/pytorch/pytorch_synthetic_benchmark.py).
