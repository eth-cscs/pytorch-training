# Write data to and read data from a TFRecord file

This notebook shows how to read and write TFRecord files.

This is based on the examples [convert_to_records.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/convert_to_records.py) and [fully_connected_reader.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/fully_connected_reader.py) on the TensorFlow repository, and on [this post](http://warmspringwinds.github.io/tensorflow/tf-slim/2016/12/21/tfrecords-guide/).
